# Create a new SQL script called limit_exercises.sql.

# MySQL provides a way to return only unique results from our queries with the keyword DISTINCT.
# For example, to find all the unique titles within the company, we could run the following query:
#
#
SELECT DISTINCT title FROM titles;
#
# List the first 10 distinct last name sorted in descending order. Your result should look like this:
select distinct last_name from employees order by last_name desc limit 10;

# Create a query to get the top 5 salaries and display just the employees number from the
# salaries table. The employee number results should be:
SELECT salaries.emp_no, salaries.salary
FROM salaries
order by salaries.salary desc
limit 5;

#     43624
#     254466
#     47978
#     253939
#     Try to think of your results as batches, sets, or pages. The
#     first five results are your first page.
#     The five after that would be your second page, etc. Update the
#     previous query to find the tenth page of results. The employee number
#     results should be:
SELECT salaries.emp_no
FROM salaries
order by salaries.salary desc
limit 4 offset 46;
